    <p class="heading">1. Can We All Transform Karamchedu in the Most Meaningful Way?</p>
    <p>In today's world, <span class="highlight italic">education</span> is the most valuable asset an individual can possess. If there is one thing that can truly transform an individual, a family, a community, and our village, it is education.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">I firmly believe that education is the key to uplifting and transforming our village, Karamchedu.</span></p>

    <br>

    <p class="heading">2. So Can We Provide Education Like the Best Schools in the Country?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We can't expect our village school to match the facilities of the best schools in the country, such as those in major cities, given the obvious limitations. Nor can we ask parents in our village to pay city-level fees to achieve this.</li>
        <li>As individuals who grew up during the digital era, we have witnessed firsthand how technology can bridge the gap between a person in a remote village and someone in the most developed city. Technology has significantly reduced, if not erased, this disparity. All we need to do is embrace it and empower ourselves with it to reduce the gap between our school and the best schools in our country.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <p class="heading">3. How Can We Use Technology to Emulate the Best Schools?</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">The main motivation behind this idea is that along with digitization, we can use tools like ChatGPT as virtual teachers to support school teachers and help students understand concepts better.</span></p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Use Projectors/SmartBoards (works Identical to Android tablets but on a bigger screen, commonly used by schools in cities) to teach lessons with videos and pictures.</span>
            <ul>
                <li>As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words. Imagine watching a movie based on your 10th class non-detail "Hounds of Baskerville." It would be much easier to understand and save a lot of time, allowing students to focus on learning rather than memorizing lessons they don’t fully grasp.</li>
                <li>Consider explaining the concept of reflection or the behavior of the moon, sun, and earth in our solar system without showing this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/b5phg2ml3YM">YouTube video</a>. Visual aids make complex topics clearer and more engaging.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Use online teaching platforms and resources like Khan Academy, YouTube videos, and educational images, etc., on lesson-related topics.</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Empower teachers and students with the best resources for learning, providing access to high-quality educational content and interactive lessons.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Use AI tools like ChatGPT</span>
            <ul>
                <li>To quote an example, you can share your screen and ask ChatGPT to solve/explain any problem/topic and have multiple people speak to it in real time.</li>
                <li>To explain any topic in the simplest way in Telugu/English.</li>
                <li>Solve any problem (be it math, physics, English, and so on).</li>
                <li>Improve communication skills by having a group discussion using that tool to correct students' grammar and communication skills.</li>
                <li>Sample videos on ChatGPT teacher-like and translation capabilities:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2DFg53Zhvw">Video 1</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nSmkyDNulk">Video 2</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Equip school with Multiple Computers and Monitors</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Teach basic computer concepts to students, preparing them for the digital age.</li>
                <li>Enable teachers and interested students to learn and research any topic using platforms like YouTube, ChatGPT, Google, and more.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Install WiFi to Empower Digital Devices</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure these digital devices are fully functional and connected to the vast resources available online.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Implement CCTV Cameras</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Monitor these devices to ensure they are used appropriately and that students do not tamper with them, maintaining a secure learning environment.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <p class="heading">4. Can’t We Provide Any of These Facilities at This Moment?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ours is the only school in Karamchedu. The government school has been shut down along with other private schools.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Based on our enquiry, schools in neighboring towns charge a minimum of 2.5 times (up to 7 times) the fees compared to ours.</span></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Even the school with 2.5 times the fees still uses physical boards and does not have projectors or smart boards in the classrooms.</span></li>
        <li>If we were to provide these facilities, we would have to significantly increase the fees, which might not be acceptable or feasible for all the parents in our village.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <p class="heading">5. Need Your Support to Provide These Facilities</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Since it is not feasible for us to provide these facilities due to budget constraints, we encourage you to donate some amount towards these improvements.</li>
        <li>Your contribution will impact not just one student, but the entire school of 330 students (as of 2023-2024 batch), and it will benefit them for several years to come.</li>
        <li>We already have had some voluntary donors, including alumni, friends, and well-wishers, who have contributed towards educational fees for poor students and rewards for 10th class toppers in the past:
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Y. Siva Krishna - Donated 15k for 10th toppers for the last few years.</span></li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Talluri Mallikarjuna - Donated 15k for 10th toppers for the last few years.</span></li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Several other donors - Covered fees for around 5 students from the 2023-2024 batch.</span></li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Ravipudi Puran Madhavi - Donated 20k for school infrastructure.</span></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Inspired by their generosity, we aim to take it further and provide even better education to the students of our school.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <p class="heading">6. Current State of the School</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I am happy to inform you that our students performed exceptionally well in the 10th exams. We had a total of 29 10th class students out of an overall 330 students from the 2023-2024 batch:
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Scores above 500 - 18 students (62%).</span></li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Scores above 450 - 24 students (82%).</span></li>
                <li><span class="highlight">First class (360 and above) - 29 students (100%).</span></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span class="highlight">We have relocated the school from our old location at Chinnavantina Centre to a new building in Hare Rama Ashramam.</span>
            We had to set up the school infrastructure from scratch as part of this move.
        </li>
        <li><span class="highlight">I personally spent around 22 lakhs on this new school infrastructure due to this relocation and to provide more facilities. This is another reason why we are currently running on a very tight budget.</span></li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <p class="heading">7. Beyond Digitalization: Enriching Extracurricular Activities</p>
    <p>Our plan is not just about digitalization but also about helping students excel in extracurricular activities with the support of your donations. We aim to conduct the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Drawing/Painting, Singing, Dance, Quiz, Debate Competitions.</li>
        <li>Chess, Rubik's Cube, Mathematics Competitions.</li>
        <li>Sports Competitions: Organize events for cricket, volleyball, and badminton to encourage physical fitness and teamwork.</li>
        <li>Attend Nearby Science Exhibitions to generate curiosity.</li>
        <li>Fancy Dress Competitions (which were conducted on a grand scale in the school in 2023).</li>
        <li>Library with some of the best-selling books recommended for people under age 15.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <p class="heading">8. Reconnecting with Alumni: A Request from the Principal</p>
    <p>As your school principal and former teacher, I have never asked for anything before, but now I have a small request.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>My main motto behind this message is to re-establish my connection with the alumni.</li>
        <li>Nothing gives me more satisfaction than having a conversation with my former students. Please set aside any inhibitions you had during school days and feel free to have a friendly conversation with me whenever you have time.</li>
        <li>I also encourage you to visit our school and take at least one class during your visit to the village. Share your life experiences, career advice, and study tips so that our students gain motivation, vision for their future, and insights into the paths they should follow and the mistakes they should avoid.</li>
        <li>Most importantly, many of you may have children or will have children in the future. As you send them to school, if you come across any aspect that could enhance a student’s learning experience, please let me know. I will strive to incorporate the same in our school.</li>
    </ul>
